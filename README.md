## FAQ


#### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Express is useful when used alongside HTML as a middlewear because it allows to render what needs to be rendered while keeping what does not need to change rendered which allows the website to load faster. JavaScript is used for making the routing and connections to the database. An SPA is useful when you need to have a fast loading page and if the development time is constrained.



#### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The reason for the use of a NoSQL database is because of the scalability and simplicity that a NoSQL database provides. Because of the simplicity in the database maintenance is also easier.

#### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

Although JSON is a derived from JavaScript the use of JavaScript and JSON are different. JSON is used for data storage and retrieval in a simple and easy manner.


#### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Separating different sections of the website that repeat where moved to different files so that if that information stays the saem and another area needs to change it can do so without having to reload the same information.


#### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Methods are needed for making request and receiving responses from the server. An endpoint is a URL where it is used by a computer or phone to access a certain web service. For security this line of comunication between device and endpoint needs to be secured so that there arent any entry points hackers can use.


#### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I feel like dealing with the backend has always been a weakness of mine. With this project I came to better understand how to MEAN stack works and also how to deal with MongoDB.
